      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Sierra Leone, officially the Republic of Sierra Leone is a West African
        nation bordered by the Republic of Guinea, the Republic of Liberia,
        and the Atlantic Ocean. The largest border is with Guinea to the
        north. Most of Sierra Leone's modern history has been shaped and
        dominated by British colonialism, the slave trade, and more recently,
        civil war. [2]</p>
      <p>Sierra Leone did not receive independence from the British empire
        until April 27th, 1961. After a short period of peace, a long reign
        of military dictators took control of the country, followed by
        a civil war in 1991, which did not end until 2002. The civil war
        depleted natural resources and destroyed significant amounts of
        infrastructure.</p>
      <p>The Ebola Virus epidemic, beginning in 2014, has significantly impacted
        the country. The recovering country was hit hard, with an almost
        50% drop in exports in 2015 compared to the previous year. The
        virus led to a nationwide three-day quarantine in September 2014.
        Currently the country is recovering from the virus and is almost
        completely clean, with some flare ups occurring. [5]</p>
      <p>The country has a 48.1% literacy rate favoring males. In information
        technology, 83 out of every 100 inhabitants has a mobile cellular
        subscription. This is a very good percentage for a nation like
        Sierra Leone. However, cellular service remains scarce and unreliable.
        Only 1.5% of the population is an internet user. [2]

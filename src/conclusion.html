      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Sierra Leone is a quickly developing country with a lot of potential. The
        government is currently stable and they are recovering from the
        Ebola epidemic. If there is a perfect time to help develop this
        strong nation, it is now. The new ACE submarine cable is connecting
        Sierra Leone to the global internet network and reducing the cost
        of communications dramatically [<a href="sources.html#source1">1</a>].
      </p>
      <p>Now is the time to develop the nation's infrastructure to support
        this new outside connection and not let it go to waste. Expanding
        and making the cellular network more robust will connect even more
        of the population with a reliable communication platform. Introducing
        cost effective mobile data to cellular subscribers will quickly
        benefit the nation as the population gets introduced to the world
        wide web and it's infinite possibilities and opportunities. These
        opportunities include the ability to allow citizens to participate
        in public health, safety, and infrastructure.</p>

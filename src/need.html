      <h2>A Pressing Need</h2>
      <p>
        Sierra Leone has a very large mobile cellular subscriber rate, but service
        is spotty and devices can not always be used as intended. Had the
        services been available during the Ebola outbreak, cases could
        have been more easily tracked and managed to limit the spread.
        As a developing nation, widespread outbreaks of deadly diseases
        are much more likely. Technologies and services need to be able
        to help the nation's population stop the spread of the disease.

      <p>The nation needs a massive expansion and upgrade of its mobile cellular
        network to connect the remaining 17% of the population that does
        not currently have a subscription, as well as provide a more robust
        service to current subscribers so that they can use their devices
        as intended. Alongside this, new services and tools need to be
        made available to the public that take advantage of the high mobile
        cellular subscription rate to monitor and track the outbreak of
        diseases and illnesses that pose a threat to the entire nation,
        as was witnessed with the Ebola epidemic.</p>

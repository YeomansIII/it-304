      <h2>Economy</h2>
      <p>
        In the past few years Sierra Leone has seen a major growth in GDP and exports.
        Sierra Leone's purchasing power parity gross domestic product (ppp
        GDP) for 2014 was $12.92 billion. However, in the later months
        of 2014 and the beginning months of 2015 brought the Ebola virus
        to Western Africa. Sierra Leone took the brunt force of this widespread
        disease and the economy of the nation felt the pain. The industrial
        production growth rate for 2015 was -51% compared to 2014. The
        ppp GDP also dipped to $9.833 billion compared to 2014's $12.92
        billion. With the slowing down of the Ebola virus and only mild
        flare-ups in the nation, the economy is back on track to expand
        and grow as it begins to define its place in the global economy.
        Industries and exports of Sierra Leone include diamond mining,
        iron ore, rutile, bauxite mining, small-scale manufacturing, petroleum
        refining, small commercial ship repair. [<a href="sources.html#source2">2</a>]

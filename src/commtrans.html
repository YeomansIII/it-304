      <h2>Communication and Transportation</h2>
      <p>
        Sierra Leone has a growing communications and transportation infrastructure.
        The vast majority of communications takes place over mobile cellular
        networks, with 4.8 million mobile subscribers (83% of the population),
        while there are only 16,500 fixed line subscriptions (&lt;1% of
        the population). Mobile cellular coverage is limited to few highly
        concentrated cities including Freetown and Kenema. Radio broadcast
        is the main mean of public media with only less than 5 public television
        stations. The country contains only 282 internet hosts and 85,600
        internet users (1.5% of the population). [<a href="sources.html#source2">2</a>]</p>
      <p>Sierra Leone has an extensive road network, but the vast majority
        of these roads are unpaved. Unpaved roads limit the transportation
        of goods and services throughout the country. There are approximately
        11,300 km of roads, where only 904 km of those roads are actually
        paved. The country manages 8 airports, with only one paved runway
        at Lungi International Airport outside of Freetown. The major ports
        in the nation are Freetown, Pepel, and Sherbro Islands. [<a href="sources.html#source2">2</a>]

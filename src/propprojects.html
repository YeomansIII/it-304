      <h2>Proposed Projects</h2>
      <p>
        It is clear that Sierra Leone has a lot of potential, but many things need
        to be done to support the country and allow citizens to focus on
        creating jobs and producing and exporting goods. The first project
        proposal is to expand and increase the density of the nation's
        mobile cellular network. Bringing the mobile cellular networks
        to the smaller towns and rural areas of Sierra Leone will connect
        the remaining 17% of the population that is not currently subscribed
        to a mobile cellular plan. Connecting the entire nation would be
        an enormous accomplishment. Increasing the density and redundancy
        of the cellular networks would ensure that subscribers in highly
        populated areas will always have service and the ability to access
        the network with their device.
      </p>
      <p>While creating new mobile cellular towers and expanding the current
        network, the new Africa Coast to Europe (ACE) submarine fiber optic
        cable connection in Freetown will be used to upgrade current and
        new cellular infrastructure. With a fiber optic connection to each
        cellular tower, mobile data services can be provided to subscribers
        for a very low cost. Current cellular subscribers in the country
        to not have many mobile data options.
      </p>
      <p>The extremely high mobile cellular subscription rate is one of Sierra
        Leone's biggest advantages. With the vast majority of the population
        connected to each other and the world via their mobile device,
        applications and services can begin to be created to help support
        the nation. The second proposal is to create a service that allows
        citizens to receive needed medical information and report unknown
        illnesses. Having up-to-date and specific medical information at
        their fingertips will allow the people to stop major disease outbreaks
        before they even start. The ability to aggregate illness and location
        information from citizens will allow authorities to watch and track
        the spread of illnesses and step in to intervene before diseases
        spread too far. These tools could also allow citizens to report
        safety and infrastructure needs.

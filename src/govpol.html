      <h2>Government and Politics</h2>
      <p>
        Sierra Leone is a constitutional republic with a legislative, executive,
        and judiciary branches. The legislature is unicameral, meaning
        that there is only one chamber, compared to the United States system
        of two chambers (the House and the Senate). The president, the
        lead of the executive branch, is directly elected by the people.
        The judiciary is headed by the Chief Justice. [3]
        <p></p>The current president of Sierra Leone is Ernest Bai Koroma,
        who assumed office on the 17th of September, 2007. Before being
        elected president, Koroma served as the Leader of the All People's
        Congress (2002-present), the Minority Leader of Parliament (2005-2007),
        and a Member of Parliament from the Bombali District (2002-2007).
        [4]
        <p></p>The only three parties in Sierra Leone that hold seats in parliament
        are the All People's Congress (APC), the Sierra Leone People's
        Party (SLPP), and the People's Movement for Democratic Change (PMDC).
        The APC and SLPP are the two oldest parties in Sierra Leone, dating
        back to 1962 and 1951, respectively. The APC currently holds more
        seats in parliament as well as holds the current presidency. [4]

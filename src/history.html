      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        Sierra Leone has been inhabited continuously for over 2,500 years. The
        inhabiting populations migrated from other portions of Africa.
        The dense tropical rainforests of Sierra Leone has protected the
        inhabitants all through history as a natural barrier to invasions
        and ideas like Islam.</p>

      <p>After the American Revolutionary War, the British Empire created
        a settlement around the now Freetown in Sierra Leone. The Empire
        created this settlement to resettle thousands of African Americans
        that were freed during the war, as well as the poorer blacks of
        London. The African American settlers built the settlement, as
        they did in the American South, and continued many American traditions.
        Being on the west coast of Africa, the settlers were subject to
        the illegal slave trade and constantly feared being re-enslaved.
        The Empire lacked in providing essential materials and protection
        to the settlement. [<a href="sources.html#source6">6</a>]

      <p>Sierra Leone gained independence from the British empire on April
        27th, 1961. The government that was established after independence
        only lasted 6 years, and what followed was 24 years of military
        coups and a one-party state until the breakout of the Sierra Leone
        civil war in 1991. The civil war did not end until 2002, severely
        depleting natural resources and destroying significant amounts
        of infrastructure. The civil war ended after British troops sent
        to the country to remove foreign nationals clashed with the rebels
        and ended up fully defeating them and restoring order. Many elements
        of the British Army remain in the country today helping restore
        infrastructure and providing financial and medical assistance.

        Sierra Leone's infrastructure has been expanding rapidly since the end
        of the nation's painful civil war. One of the most prominent infrastructure
        developments was the connection of Freetown to the Africa Coast
        to Europe (ACE) submarine fiber optic cable [<a href="sources.html#source1">1</a>].
        This 17,000 km submarine fiber optic cable now connects Sierra
        Leone to 16 other West African nations as well as Portugal and
        France [<a href="sources.html#source1">1</a>]. This is the first
        submarine fiber optic cable that has been landed in Sierra Leone.
        This connection allows Sierra Leone to connect to international
        broadband at a lower cost as well as provide significantly higher
        speeds. Providing affordable and fast broadband internet allows
        increased social and economic development [<a href="sources.html#source1">1</a>].</p>
